## Introduction to my user
Hi, I am Gruemma28, a learning programmer, I like to use Java Script and Python for my projects. **Feel free to contact me on Discord in any case.** I consider myself a video game developer using game engines and code.



## Facts about me:

- I like developing videogames using the **Unreal Engine** and **Blender** for 3D modeling.
- I'm learning to read binary code and brainfuck.
- And I would like to create my own community forum.

## Networks and others:

 You can check my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEpb_NoX-DG1x-0Y-4Qg1yg), where even though I upload unrelated things I would like to upload things on the subject.
